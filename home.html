            <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
            <p>As a Taiwanese native, my wife has always encouraged me to indulge in the flavors of her childhood and 
                the cherished recipes passed down from her grandmother. Each dish she prepares is a delightful symphony 
                of taste and tradition, leaving me in awe every time. "You could sell this," I'd often remark, impressed
                 by her culinary prowess. So, in November 2022, we took a leap of faith and launched our first 
                 market stall. Though the hours are long, the journey has been incredibly rewarding. We've had the 
                 pleasure of meeting countless wonderful individuals and the heartwarming feedback we've received has 
                 fueled our passion even more.

                "We ordered the pork size bowl when we got out of Decathlon in Surrey Quays. 
                The bowl comes with a fried egg and fresh onions. The sauce/broth that comes with 
                the rice is very tasty! Mix of sweet and salty. I regret not getting one of the 
                sandwiches as they looked amazing, but we had already ordered some food from the other stalls. 
                The lady who served our food was super nice and friendly ðŸ’š. 
                I'm sure we will be back!"
